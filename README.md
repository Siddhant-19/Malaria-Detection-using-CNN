# Malaria-Detection-using-CNN

**This project aims to contribute towards Sustainable Development Goal 3 as stated by WHO.**

After more than a decade of steady advances in fighting malaria, progress has stalled.  No significant gains were made in reducing the number of malaria cases worldwide in the period 2015–2017. Sub-Saharan Africa continues to carry the heaviest burden of disease, accounting for more than 90 per cent of the global malaria burden. Worryingly, there were an estimated 3.5 million more malaria cases in the 10 highest-burden African countries in 2017 compared with the previous year.

Built a CNN model to classify thin-blood smear images into healthy and malaria infected cells.
